# Volume computation and sampling

## About
The `volesti` package provides [R](https://www.r-project.org/) with functions for volume estimation and sampling. In particular, it provides an R interface for the C++ library [**volesti**](https://github.com/GeomScale/volesti).

`volesti` computes approximations of volume of polytopes given as a set of points or linear inequalities or as a Minkowski sum of segments (zonotopes). There are algorithms for volume approximation as well as algorithms for sampling, rounding and rotating polytopes. Last but not least, `volesti` provides implementations of geometric algorithms to compute the score of a portfolio given asset returns and to detect financial crises in stock markets.


The latest **stable** version is available from CRAN.

##  Download and install

To use the development version you need to follow these steps:

* Clone the `Rvolesti` repository.

* Build and install the package by running (from an `R` terminal):
```R
Rcpp::compileAttributes()
devtools::build()
install.packages("volesti")
```
or from a bash terminal:
```bash
Rscript -e 'Rcpp::compileAttributes()'
R CMD INSTALL --no-multiarch --with-keep.source .
```

The following packages should be installed: `Rcpp`, `RcppEigen`, `BH`, `devtools`.

Optionally the user can run tests and examples by running (from an `R` terminal):

```R
devtools::test()
devtools::run_examples()
```
## Documentation

The user can generate or update the documentation:

```R
Rcpp::compileAttributes() # updates the Rcpp layer from C++ to R
roxygen2::roxygenize(roclets="rd") # updates the docs based on roxygen comments
```

and generate a pdf with the docs:

```R
pack = "volesti"
path = find.package(pack)
system(paste(shQuote(file.path(R.home("bin"), "R")), "CMD", "Rd2pdf", shQuote(path)))
```

The documentation contains examples for all available functions.
More examples are available in `man/examples` directory.
